1. Briefly discuss how you implemented each functionality: setting up
   interfaces, setting up default routes, and setting up
   per-destination routes.
    We used the ip addr command to set up the interfaces and the ip route command to set up default routes and pre-destination routes.

2. Are there known issues or functions that aren't working currently in your
   attached code? If so, explain.
    After extensive testing, we haven't found any issues with the code.

3. What problems did you face developing code for this project?
    The biggest problem was becoming familiar with mininet as we had never used it before, but once we found our footing it wasn't too difficult.

4. What did you learn by working on this project?
    We learned about routers and pathing between networks by creating a real life example. Actually working with one can be quite different from hearing about it in a lecture.
